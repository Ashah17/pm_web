A nice aerial video showcasing Guysborough County N.S with Lake Macpherson and Port Shoreham!
Nobody calls this lake Macpherson
Oh, what do we call it?
It's been Macpherson's Lake long before I was born and I'm 44. Not lake Macpherson. I had the pleasure of cold morning swimming lessons there and friends with places there.

It's kind of like posting in Alberta and calling it Louise lake lol
