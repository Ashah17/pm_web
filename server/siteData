Trout man BBQ in concord is really good. Also,wayside diner is amazing as well. In downtown concord the ice cream creamery is very good.
Here are some of my favorites:

Popular night life.
If you're already in Concord, check out Concord Mills.  Very large outlet mall.
In Concord stop by Charlotte Motor Speedway.  For $5 you can take a tour of the track in which they drive you around the track and down the drag strip.  Interesting and inexpensive if you have never been to a track before.  There are a bunch of good places to eat/drink just south of there in the University area.  For good beer and decent food try the Flying Saucer.  If you have specific interests it might be a little easier to give some better recommendations.
while you're in charlotte you should definitely check out the penguin diner and dish. 

the penguin is greasy fried food but its really good, the fried pickles are famous.

dish is southern comfort food, mac and cheese, meatloaf and chicken and dumplins made from scratch every day. they're insane.

also, the epicenter in charlotte is great, they have a really amazing bowling alley and the movie theater is cool as well, if not a big expensive.
Try the Diamond. Its ran under the original management of the Penguin, been told lately the penguin isn't want it used to be due to new management 

also the Diamond is right next door to the Penguin
Guy comes to Charlotte sub for Charlotte advice. Gets two of the worst places possible recommended. 
Yes, the Diamond is the place to go.  Penguin does have cheerwine though, which makes it not nearly as lame as some people have said.
admittedly, i haven't been to the penguin in years, i don't live in charlotte anymore. but i have fond memories, it used to be excellent.
Seriously.  Don't go to Penguin or Epicenter. 
The penguin is not what it used to be, the food is very very average and the atmosphere is stale. 

 Diamond and Pinky's do carry on the food well but you can't replicate that atmosphere.
