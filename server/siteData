Seeing the band Enter The Haggis at The Shalin Liu Performance Center. Staying in Rockport for two nights. Know nothing about the area and like to eat where locals hang out. Any suggestions for food, or great bars would be great. I will find a beach, but need a restaurant for the second night.

<cracks knuckles> I was born for this.

Feather and Wedge is a nice sit down meal. 

Roy Moore's Lobster Shack (the actual Shack that's further up the neck) is a terrific lobster. The small restaurant across the street (something Bistro) has great fries.

Top Dog has great hot dogs and reasonable prices.

Red Skiff on Mt. Pleasant has nice fast breakfast and lunch. If you can get into Gloucester, Sugar Magnolia's is the best breakfast in the area.

Brother's Brew, right by the Shalin Liu has great donuts and good coffee. Bean and Leaf also has great pastries and coffee, OK sandwiches. Helmuts has very good strudel. 

In retrospect, I've listed basically every place to eat except Blue Lobster (skippable) and My Place by the Sea (good but very expensive). Rockport is not a big town.

EDIT: I see you asked about great bars. Bad news: Rockport was dry until very recently, and now you can only get drinks if you're ordering a meal. If you want a bar, head out to Gloucester.

EDIT2: Molly's or Sundays for ice cream after the show.
For food in Gloucester cruise port or causeway if you can get a seat. For bars I would say check out the brewery then head across the street to cafe drift or next door at mingle wood. Mike marker which is across from causeway is where everyone goes nowadays so it’ll most likely be packed but has live music on the weekends. Then head to stones pub for a night cap since it’ll be open a little later then everywhere else.
virgilios is an amazing bakery
Top dog is a muuuuust and Hoola Moon for shaved ice 
Thank you all. reddit has proven to me once again that you don't need a travel agent.  If you are ever in Connecticut I shall return the favor. 
Might I add My Place by the Sea to this list 
I’m sitting at Roy Moore’s as I read this. It’s great. 
So maybe I should modify my question. Will hang on Main Street Rockport for the night of the show. Short walk to the Inn. The next night I will Uber to Gloucester. Anything I should check out there?  (or avoid for that matter)
Feather and Wedge is a very nice meal. The bar is pricey but the food is quality. Show is in 45 minutes. Great location as well. Thank you!
This.  I loved Minglewood as a pub and Cape Ann Brewing is awesome for beers/grub.  
HA!  One of my sandwiches in Gloucester advertised the bread came from Virgilios!

You may, but I already got it. <puts on sunglasses>
Thanks!
Short and Main is real good. I've heard great things about Tonno, which is newer. Cape Ann Brewing is good for a local beer and wings. 
Glad you enjoyed!
Must have missed it 
>My Place by the Sea

We ate there the second night. Calling for reservations at noon for their limited seating was an experience. Took us 30 minutes of constant cell phone calls to get an answer. The apparent manager or owner said people have called up to 150 times after noon to get a table. Food was good. The staff were kind of awkward. Can't explain it. I had to tell our waiter four times we had researched, and this was where we are spending our evening. He rushed the wine order, and then repeatedly asked what do you want for dinner. Just thought it was odd to be pressured to order @ 7:30 when the kitchen closes at nine.

Feather and Wedge was perfect, laid back, and oh so good. Fun and lively.  My place by the sea, food was great, the location and sunset is just ridiculous, - the experience was just off a little.

**edit/  Thank you again. Your suggestions were spot on.**
