Hi ! I'm not from the Northeast but have the opportunity to spend a day in Boston with my teenager son. What should we do? My initial thoughts are the Freedom Trail and the JFK Library. Can these be done in one day? Where should we eat? We love cafes and bakeries. My son loves history. Any help is appreciated. 
Go to Fenway! They even do tours there.

Freedom trail would be good too but for the JFK library, you may have to take to train or drive out a bit. Do a duck tour. Trolley tour. Or just walk around fanueil Hall.
Did the freedom trail about a month ago during a 1-day trip to Boston! We downloaded the national park services app & brought headphones to do their self-guided tour instead of doing a guided tour. You could do it in a couple hours but you wouldn't get the whole experience. We spent a couple hours just in the cemeteries along the stop looking at the super cool headstones & some super famous ones. We started about 10:30 and had a late lunch along the way near Faneuil Hall. We came back to North End for an amazing Italian dinner and stopped by one of the Italian bakeries on the way back to the hotel.
Boston is quite walkable, but the JFK library is a bit out of the way. The freedom trail is a great start, but you can continue through Boston Common and then walk along either commonwealth avenue or Newbury street to the Prudential center and on to Fenway park to watch a game, if they are in town.  Along the way, you’ll see a lot of the highlights. Another option is Cambridge to see Harvard Square, but it’s a bit out of the way for a walk from the freedom trail
I grew up there and it’s still one of my favorite cities! I personally don’t think an evening Sox game should be missed! Great way to end a good day in Boston… aside from that if you’re into bakeries and good food the north end is certainly where you should prioritize lunch time! Walk up Hanover street and find something you like and get dessert at mikes for a popular tourist place, or modern for a perhaps less touristy place and a bit more authenticity. Either one is great and there are dozens of good restaurants!
Bakeries, you say?  You've picked the right city.  

After the Freedom Trail, get a cannoli in the North End.  I know, it's just a cannoli, but I can't lie, it's pretty fantastic there, better than most I've ever had, including my former home of NJ.  Where to get the best one seems to be a hotly debated issue, but I much enjoyed the one I had at Modern Pastry.

Flour Bakery is a local chain, with some very tasty baked goods. You can get a Boston Cream Pie there, and also I had a "homemade Pop Tart" there which was pretty fantastic, housemade berry jam inside and all.
Do you think I could Uber to the JFK library from where ever the Freedom Trail ends? We'll be taking a bus in from Worcester. I haven't checked the location of the bus station yet but I am hoping the Freedom Trail is fairly close to it.
This is a really easy and good highlight tour that I'd highly recommend. I haven't been to the library, but some other add-on options are the old warship constitution (old iron sides... which is on the trail but a little far from the rest), Harvard, MIT, just hanging out on the waterfront, or a Red Sox game.
Thanks! Neither of us are baseball fans...I know, I know...that's like a sin probably. Bakeries, good food and some history are more our jam.
Yes, bakeries! My son aspires to be a pastry chef and bakery owner one day so he is all about trying good bakeries. We will be hitting up a French one in Falmouth on this trip too. Can't think of the name of it at the moment but I believe it's well know?!
Yes you can. It'll be easier and drop you right there.
I personally wouldn’t leave Fenway out of a history of Boston either!
The Freedom Trail will take you through Hannover Street, which has Mike's Pastry (don't miss the Lobster Tail!) and Modern Pastry within a few blocks.  Not far from the trail is the Omni Parker House which has the original Boston Cream Pie (small versions usually available in the shop but you have to pre-order the big one).
Ok if we can manage it on the day we are there we'll go. Thanks for your suggestions and help! We're excited to visit. We've never been. Visiting family in Worcester and could only fit a one day excursion to Boston with all our other plans. Hoping to make the most of it.
Haha if it’s not your thing probably not worth it if we’re being honest, but it’s an awesome area! I hope you enjoy your trip!
