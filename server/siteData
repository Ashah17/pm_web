Hi all! I’m a 27 year old Australian female about to embark on a 5 week trip to see almost every little part of Italy after visiting the main tourist cities a few years ago. I’ve not yet been to Milan and will fly out from there so will stay there a few nights at the end of my trip but I was wondering whether I should also stay the night at nearby Lake Como? 

I understand it’s very much a wedding destination and obviously beautiful so I presume accom would cost a little more but my travel agent suggested a day trip catching the train from Milan would suffice because she said Lake Como is quite small. Would it be worth staying a night (I’m happy to pay a little extra but not too much) so I’m able to enjoy dinner and drinks at night or would a day be enough time to wander around and see all its beauty? I’d be going there late July/early August. Any advice would be much appreciated!

Lake Como is my favourite place in the world, and I particularly like the mid-lake region (Varenna, Bellagio etc). I imagine that would be hard to do on a daytrip, so I would definitely recommend an overnight - either in Como itself (more options, and likely cheaper) or in one of the midlake towns (I stay at Hotel la Darsena in Tremezzo, but that’s ~€180/night I think so I’m sure there are much cheaper options).
I think staying a night is a good idea.
I didn't find the city of Como to be very pretty but you could stay in any of the towns by the lake. 
There is a train connecting Varenna directly from Milano so it could be a nice choice. Also, you could check one of the Villas the towns have and also find some place to swim or at least put your feet on the water for a while.

Nightlife in Como is nothing special, I wouldn't recommend it. Though there are many things you can do. Some are, 
* from Como take the funicular to Brunate and enjoy a drink with a view on the City and the Lake (800m high). If you like you can walk to the lighthouse (faro Voltiano) and then up and admire an even better view on the lake and hills!
* take the bus to Bellagio, a town popular for the beauty, the view and the fancy hotels and restaurants
* or you can stop on the other side and visit first Villa Carlotta, famous for the beauty of its gardens and then Menaggio which I recommend
* even closer to Como, reachable by bus there's Argegno. Take a coffee on the lake there and then the funicular to Pigra where you can enjoy (one of my favourite) a fantastic view on the lake!
*  You can take the ferry from Como and explore the lake a bit. It might take a few hours and be a bit expensive

Have a nice trip across Italy!
I stayed the night in Varenna on Lake Como last summer with my wife and we loved it. We stayed in an Airbnb with amazing hosts that made us dinner with fresh truffles they had hunted with their dog. We rented a boat for the day in Varenna and it was easily the most fun experience we had in Italy. We didn’t need a boating license, and it was super easy to learn. I highly recommend it!
Thank you so much everyone for your help! I have now booked two nights in Menaggio.
i've been there twice, always day trips. Try to go on a weekday as it'll be less crowded.
My friends and I stayed in a hostel on lake como and had the best time!
I went years ago and did a day trip going around on the boats from place to place. I had to run to catch one of the boats and also run for the last train back to Milan. I had a great time but could probably have explored more if I had stayed overnight. Not sure if it would get too boring and if the little towns are too quiet in the evenings to make it worth the while (eg… I’ve stayed elsewhere overnight in small towns that were dead at night, couldn’t find a good place for a solo person to eat, should have just made a day trip). If you have a tight itinerary a day trip should be just fine.
There's some nice hiking in the area if that's something you enjoy. Even if not, staying at least a night would give you more time to explore the area a bit.
Did a day trip, but would like to go back and spend a night in either Bellagio or Varenna next time.
Interesting! I’ll keep this in mind thanks
Thank you for the detailed reply! I will definitely explore these options :)
